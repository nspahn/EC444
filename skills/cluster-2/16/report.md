## Summary
This skill involved building and learning a basic program in Node js. Node js enables us to host javascript outside of a browser so that backend and front endpoints can be delivered to develop network enabled functionality to the user. This program will read in the serial output from one of the past skills and reflect that on the Node.js server. By using a local host I was able to represent a single int of data on the node.js server.

## Modules, Tools, Source Used Including Attribution
The modules involved in building this project involved a sinple basis to create the Node.js server which was built from the hello world example then a module that read from the serial port, wrote that to a temporary variable and finally printed that integer to the front of the local index.html page. The C3 tutorials were followed and the basis code provided was built on. The input serial was the thermistor voltage sensor reading as it was the cleanest that I was communicating wth the serial throughout hte skills.
