## Summary
In this skill we used the micro-usb converter to flash a solid state memory device in the rasberry pi. This was done to ensure wireless communication was possible as you host on a rasberry pi a Node.js server and communicate wirelessly though our local machines. Some trouble was had at first but after I was able to sucsessfullytest my pi on my routers own wifi connection ssh become easy. 

## Sketches and Photos


## Modules, Tools, Source Used Including Attribution
Most all the code was given in Noobs and online for this project. I used the hello world example on Node.js W3 to test my resberry pi. After flashing the current operating system NOObS was used to install a new operating system for the pi.  The utility in this process was to enable wireless updates to an external server simulated with this rasberry pi.
