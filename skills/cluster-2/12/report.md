## Summary
This skill was an exercise in displaying the incoming adc voltage on an alpha display. Similar to past skills this required the alpha display was to display the most recent value read by the adc. By manipulating the example code, and integrating past alpha display data I was able to display a 2 fidget voltage on the alpha display.
