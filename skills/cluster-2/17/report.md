## Summary
This skill was about learning canvas.js. With this tool we were given the goal to graph the sample data using some node .js examples or other graphical tool. In the past I have used Thingspeak for my database and analysis needs so while I aimed to learn Node.js in this process I was far more sucsessful at getting visualisaitons in thingspeak which could be pulled to any html page with an <iframe> block

## Modules, Tools, Source Used Including Attribution
The modules involved in the creation of this for Node.js were modules to read and parse the csv file as well as modules to call the canvas js visualisaiton with the given csv data. I was not ableto get my data to host correctly but my methodology is sound. I was able to simulate the visualisation on thingspeak which I have included an image of below.
