## Summary
This was as similar skill to skill 12 in that we were utilizing the adc converter to read incoming voltage values. A voltage divider was used in combination with a thermistor to use the voltage fluctuations to sense temperature around the resistive element.

## Modules, Tools, Source Used Including Attribution
The functions involved in this process were a function to calibrate the resistive element and a read  voltage values to the cool every 2 seconds.
