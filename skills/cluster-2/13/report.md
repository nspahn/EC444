## Summary
This was as similar skill to skill 12 in that we were utilizing the adc converter to read incoming voltage values. A voltage divider was used in combination with a thermistor to use the voltage fluctuations to sense temperature around the resistive element.

## Modules, Tools, Source Used Including Attribution
The functions involved in this process were a function to calibrate the resistive element and a read  voltage values to the cool every 2 seconds. The thermistor used was a 10K resistor at room tempature and this value was used with the voltage devider also including an additional 10K of resistance to measure the changing resistive nature of the thermistor. In this case the thermistor was calibrated with a beta value of 36000.
