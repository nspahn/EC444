## Summary
This skill is another distance skill that utilizes the adc. Rather than utilizing sonar as the distance measurement the sensor uses a IR projector detector to detect range. The mechanism detects the distance in a similar means by translating the reflection echo into a return voltage and that is read back into the adc. Through calibration of the IR sensor the distance can be read to the console every 2 seconds.
