## Summary
In this steam skill, the TX/TR communications were used and leader protocol to listen and follow a single leader for changes in the state of the device. The TX? TR PROtocol was modified from the base protocol example code and was modified to enable a single leader to be selected when conflicting signals are sent. We had a challenge in the skill in which the communication would try to usurp each other's roles. Still, by setting rules for leader limitations in the state machine, we created a voting mechanism with the wireless communication protocol.
